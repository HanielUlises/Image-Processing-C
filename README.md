# Image Processing Algorithms with C

---

This repository contains a collection of image processing techniques implemented in C, including:

- **Binarization**: Converts images to binary by applying thresholding techniques.
- **Brightness Adjustment**: Modifies the brightness levels of images.
- **Convolution**: Applies discrete 2D convolution for various image effects like blurring and edge detection.
- **Image Copying**: Duplicates image data from one source to another.
- **Grayscale Conversion**: Transforms colored images into grayscale.
- **Histogram Manipulation**: Adjusts image brightness and contrast using histogram operations.

This repository serves as a resource for learning and implementing fundamental image processing techniques using C.
